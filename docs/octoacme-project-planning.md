# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Cross-Role Handoffs During Planning
To prevent gaps and ensure clear accountability, the following handoffs should occur during planning:

- **Business Analyst → Product Manager:** Validated requirements and business cases
- **Business Analyst → Developers:** Detailed functional specifications
- **UX Designer → Product Manager:** User research findings and design specifications
- **UX Designer → Developers:** Design mockups, prototypes, and implementation guidelines
- **Security Officer → Product/Engineering:** Security requirements and compliance constraints
- **DevOps Engineer → PM:** Infrastructure needs, deployment constraints, and timeline estimates

**Reference:** Handoff clarifications address process gaps identified in [sai-sharvan/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces#4](https://github.com/sai-sharvan/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/4)

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
