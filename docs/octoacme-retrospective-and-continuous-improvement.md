# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates the retrospective, ensures psychological safety, and tracks action items

**Reference:** Scrum Master facilitation role per [sai-sharvan/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces#4](https://github.com/sai-sharvan/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/4)
